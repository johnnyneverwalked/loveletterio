# LoveLetter IO

Browser-based implementation of the popular Loveletter card game.
Created with jquery, node, socket.io and express.

Simply download and use npm run to start the server. The server runs at port 1234.
In the browser just enter a name, create a room or join a friend's room and start playing right away! No account needed

I did not use the original card images for obvious copyright reasons.

## TODO:
* Break code into different files for more maintainability and readability
* Add room password support
* Add socket namespaces (currently I use different rooms in the same namespace)
* Refactor CSS and html (It works fine but it is really messy)
